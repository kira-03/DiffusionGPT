# DiffusionGPT: Unified Text-to-Image Generation System

This project is being undertaken as part of our Natural Language Processing (NLP) course, where we will investigate the capabilities of DiffusionGPT and its applications in text-to-image generation. Our objective is to analyze its performance, explore its functionalities, and understand its potential impact on various use cases in the field of artificial intelligence.

## Objectives

- Analyze the performance of DiffusionGPT in generating images from textual descriptions.
- Explore the functionalities and features of DiffusionGPT.
- Understand the potential applications and impact of text-to-image generation in AI.

## Resources
