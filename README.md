# DiffusionGPT: Unified Text-to-Image Generation System

DiffusionGPT is a versatile text-to-image generation system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and integrates domain-specific generative models. It employs Trees-of-Thought to efficiently parse diverse prompts and select the most appropriate model for generating high-quality images across various domains. 

This project is being implemented as part of our NLP course, where we will explore the capabilities of DiffusionGPT and its applications in text-to-image generation.
